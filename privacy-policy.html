          We collect personal data only when you contact us through our contact
          form. The information we may collect includes your name, email
          address, and any message you provide. We do not collect any data from

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain the personal data collected through the contact form only as
          long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected.
          Once it is no longer needed, we will securely delete or anonymize the
          data.
        </p>
